## Database Design

The database structure is designed to support all core functionalities of the Airbnb clone platform:

### User Entity

- **Fields**: user_id (Primary Key), email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, phone_number, profile_picture, created_at, updated_at
- **Relationships**: One-to-many with Properties (as host), one-to-many with Bookings (as guest), one-to-many with Reviews

### Property Entity

- **Fields**: property_id (Primary Key), host_id (Foreign Key), title, description, location, price_per_night, max_guests, amenities, created_at, updated_at
- **Relationships**: Many-to-one with User (host), one-to-many with Bookings, one-to-many with Reviews, one-to-many with PropertyImages

### Booking Entity

- **Fields**: booking_id (Primary Key), property_id (Foreign Key), guest_id (Foreign Key), check_in_date, check_out_date, total_price, booking_status, created_at
- **Relationships**: Many-to-one with Property, many-to-one with User (guest), one-to-one with Payment

### Review Entity

- **Fields**: review_id (Primary Key), property_id (Foreign Key), user_id (Foreign Key), rating, comment, created_at
- **Relationships**: Many-to-one with Property, many-to-one with User

### Payment Entity

- **Fields**: payment_id (Primary Key), booking_id (Foreign Key), amount, payment_method, transaction_id, payment_status, created_at
- **Relationships**: One-to-one with Booking

**Entity Relationships Summary:**

- Users can host multiple properties and make multiple bookings
- Properties belong to one host but can have multiple bookings and reviews
- Bookings connect guests with properties and link to payments
- Reviews are submitted by users for properties they've experienced
- Payments are processed for each confirmed booking

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management System

A comprehensive authentication and profile management system that handles user registration, login, and profile customization. Users can create accounts as either guests or hosts, manage their personal information, and maintain their booking history and hosting portfolio.

### Property Management

An intuitive system for hosts to list, edit, and manage their properties. This includes uploading property images, setting availability calendars, managing pricing, and updating property descriptions and amenities to attract potential guests.

### Advanced Search and Filtering

A powerful search engine that allows guests to find properties based on location, dates, price range, amenities, and property type. The system provides real-time availability checking and intelligent recommendations based on user preferences.

### Booking System

A seamless reservation system that handles the entire booking workflow from property selection to confirmation. It includes calendar integration, pricing calculations, booking modifications, and cancellation management with appropriate policies.

### Review and Rating System

A two-way review system where both guests and hosts can rate and review each other after completed stays. This builds trust within the platform and helps future users make informed decisions based on authentic feedback.

### Payment Processing

A secure and reliable payment gateway integration that handles various payment methods, processes transactions, manages refunds, and ensures PCI compliance for all financial operations within the platform.

### Messaging System

An integrated communication platform that enables guests and hosts to communicate before, during, and after bookings. This includes automated notifications, booking confirmations, and real-time messaging capabilities.

## API Security

Security is paramount in protecting user data and ensuring safe transactions across the platform:

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Token-based Authentication**: Implements secure token-based authentication to verify user identity and maintain session security across all API endpoints.
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their role (guest, host, admin).
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Optional additional security layer for sensitive operations like payment processing and account management.

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data including passwords, payment information, and personal details are encrypted both in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implements throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse, DDoS attacks, and ensure fair usage across all users.

### Payment Security

- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Adheres to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards for handling credit card information securely.
- **Tokenization**: Credit card numbers are tokenized and never stored in plain text within the application database.
- **Fraud Detection**: Implements automated systems to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and suspicious activities.

### Privacy & Compliance

- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensures user data handling complies with General Data Protection Regulation requirements for EU users.
- **Data Minimization**: Collects and processes only necessary user data required for platform functionality.
- **Audit Logging**: Maintains comprehensive logs of all security-relevant events for monitoring and compliance purposes.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the development, testing, and deployment process, ensuring code quality and rapid, reliable releases.

### Why CI/CD is Important

CI/CD pipelines are crucial for maintaining code quality, reducing deployment risks, and enabling rapid feature delivery. They automate testing, catch bugs early in the development cycle, ensure consistent deployments, and allow the team to focus on writing code rather than manual deployment processes.

### Tools and Implementation

#### GitHub Actions

- **Automated Testing**: Runs comprehensive test suites on every pull request and commit to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Implements linting, code formatting, and security vulnerability scanning as part of the pipeline.
- **Multi-environment Deployment**: Automatically deploys to staging environments for testing and production environments upon approval.

#### Docker Integration

- **Containerization**: Packages the application and its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that run consistently across different environments.
- **Environment Parity**: Ensures development, staging, and production environments are identical, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Scalability**: Enables easy horizontal scaling and orchestration using container management platforms.

#### Deployment Strategy

- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Maintains two identical production environments to enable zero-downtime deployments and quick rollbacks if issues arise.
- **Database Migrations**: Automated database schema updates and data migrations as part of the deployment process.
- **Health Checks**: Automated monitoring and health verification after deployments to ensure system stability.
